# 1.Bike Sharing Project

In this project I built a neural network from scratch and use it to predict daily bike rentals. It is a multi layer network contains an input and output layer as well as a single hidden layer.  

# 2.Dog Classification Project

In this project I developed a CNN for detecting and dog and human images and determine the breed of dog if it's a dog image and which dog given human resembles if it is a human image. CNN is developed from scratch and consists of 4 convolutional and 4 fully-connected layers. Also, transfer  learning is implemented by using a pre-trained model.

# 2.MNIST Handwritten Digit Database - MLP Project

In this project I implemented MLP model to MNIST Database to predict the the actual digit for each handwritten digit image. I used 2 hidden layers and a dropout to avoid overfitting. I used cross-entropy as a loss function and implement SGD as an optimizer.
